# Bolt AIHostAdapter Demo

### This panel is very barebones and [relies on AIHostAdapter](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/CEP_11.x/AIHostAdapter) to function, which you [must install manually in your program files](https://community.adobe.com/t5/illustrator-discussions/aihostadapter-plugin-windows-install/td-p/12727345) as an SDK extension. This panel creates a quick scripting call each time the selection of the document is changed to update in console as an example of how to implement AIHostAdapter in a Bolt project.
